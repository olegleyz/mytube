# Video Playback 101

To play a video in a browser using adaptive streaming, the system must go through several steps after a raw video is uploaded.

## 1. Transcoding and Chunking

The raw video is transcoded into formats like **DASH (MPEG-DASH)** or **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**. Transcoding includes:

* **Splitting the video into small segments**, usually 2 to 10 seconds long. This allows the player to start playing the video as soon as it receives the first chunk.
* **Creating multiple versions** of the video at different resolutions and bitrates (e.g. 240p, 480p, 720p). This allows the player to adjust quality based on network speed.
* **Generating a manifest file**, which lists available video qualities and the paths to the video chunks.

These chunks and the manifest file are stored in blob storage (like S3) and cached in CDN (like CloudFront).

## 2. Serving the Video

The backend provides a REST API for clients to fetch metadata and a manifest URL:

```
GET /videos/:videoId
```

This returns information like title, duration, thumbnail, and a URL to the manifest file. We want to protect access to the manifest and segments using signed URLs or access tokens to prevent unauthorized or excessive access.

## 3. Playback in the Browser

On the frontend:

* A video player library like **dash.js** or **hls.js** takes the manifest URL.
* The player reads the manifest to:

  * Select a resolution based on current network conditions.
  * Download video chunks as needed.
  * Buffer and decode them for playback.

The player handles switching resolutions if the connection improves or degrades.

## 4. Notes

* **DASH** is an open standard. Not supported natively on Safari, but works with dash.js.
* **HLS** is developed by Apple. Natively supported on Safari and iOS.
* Shorter chunks improve startup time and responsiveness, but increase request overhead.
* You can secure video access using signed URLs or access tokens if needed.
